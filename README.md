Deep Learning for Multimodal Brain Imaging Analysis: A Fusion Approach for Classifying Healthy Aging, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Alzheimer's Disease.
Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) accurately and early continues to pose a challenge. This research introduces a learning approach that excels in accuracy and interpretability, opening up new possibilities for improving AD diagnosis. This method's core is a fusion technique applied to modal brain imaging data, specifically MRI and FDG PET scans. It incorporates three components: firstly, capturing interactions between structural and functional brain data to detect better subtle changes associated with AD. Secondly, a new fusion layer integrates features from both types of scans while emphasizing the important ones for classification, making the model more interpretable for clinical use. Lastly, an ensemble classifier with attention-based weighting combines models to produce generalizable results.
